## Introduction

The CSES Problem Set is an excellent resource for practicing competitive programming. It covers a wide range of topics and problem types, making it a great tool for improving your problem-solving skills. This repository aims to provide you with a comprehensive collection of solutions to these problems in C++, along with explanations of the approaches used.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with each problem in its own folder:

```bash
CSES-Problem-Set-Solutions
│
├── Problem1
│ ├── problem.cpp
│
├── Problem2
│ ├── problem.cpp
│
├── Problem3
│ ├── problem.cpp
│
└── ...
```

Each folder contains a `problem.cpp` file with the solution for that particular problem.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CSES-Problem-Set-Solutions.git
   cd CSES-Problem-Set-Solutions
2. **Browse Solutions**

   Navigate to the folder of the problem you're interested in. Each folder is named according to the problem's title or identifier.

3. **Run Solutions**

   Each solution file `problem.cpp` can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler. For example, to compile and run the solution in Problem1:
    ```bash
    cd Problem1
    g++ -o problem problem.cpp
    ./problem
## Installing g++ Compiler

If you want to compile and run C++ code locally, you will need the `g++` compiler. Here’s how to install it on Linux and macOS:

### Linux

For Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu), you can install `g++` with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++

```
